        Hi! Welcome to my website.<br><br>

        I am a PhD student attending <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/">McGill University</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a> under the co-supervision of <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~derek/">Derek Nowrouzezahrai</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/person/pal-christopher/">Christopher Pal</a>.<br><br>

        I am interested in taking nature-inspired approaches to solving vision and graphics problems, via artificial intelligence. As such, <b>my research interests covers various topics underlying complex systems and artificial intelligence, such as differentiable self-organization, generative modeling with/of complex systems, collective intelligence, emergent phenomena, and neural dynamical systems</b> to name a few. Lately, I have been attracted to Neural Cellular Automata, investigating applications that may benefit from their robust, scalable, and adaptive dynamical nature.<br><br>

        I am a practicing interdisciplinary artist and DJ based in <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/indigenous/land-and-peoples/learn-about-land-and-peoples-tiohtiake-montreal">Tiohtià:ke/Montréal</a>, having formerly hosted a radio show at <a href="https://n10.as">n10.as</a> called <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/n10as/08_23_2019_focalpointmp3/">Focal Point</a>, and have published artworks at venues such as the <a href="https://canada-culture.org/en/a-propos/">Canadian Cultural Centre</a> in Paris and <a href="https://www.elektramontreal.ca/contact">ELEKTRA</a> in Tiohtià:ke/Montréal. During my free time I volunteer at <a href="https://n10.as">n10.as</a>, enjoy playing all kinds of videogames, bike, DJ, and play with my two cats.<br><br>

        Adjacent to my research interests lies my community goal of democratizing knowledge surrounding AI-based concepts, vocabulary, and algorithms to artists and underprivileged groups for the purposes of self-empowerment and awareness of the capabilities of AI models, harmful or otherwise. To that end, I'm heavily invested in community-building activities catered to the broader arts community as well as BIPOC and LGBTQ+ groups.<br><br>
